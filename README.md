# Tip Calculator App

This is an app used to calculate how much to tip restaurants. This is a challenge set on frontendmentor.io, the details are [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX).

I had previously completed this challenge [here](https://github.com/puyanwei/fe-practice) but stopped my Azure subscription for its deployment so decided it would be fun to redo it again but use a more updated tech stack.
