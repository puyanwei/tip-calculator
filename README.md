# Tip Calculator App

This is an app used to calculate how much to tip restaurants. This is a challenge set on frontendmentor.io, the details are [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX).

I had previously completed this challenge [here](https://github.com/puyanwei/fe-practice) but stopped my Azure subscription for its deployment so decided it would be fun to redo it again but use my favourite tech stack;

- Next.js
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind

Deployed url - https://tip-calculator-livid-alpha.vercel.app/
